# Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a provided dataset. Below are the questions and tasks related to this dataset:

## Questions to Answer

1. **Which date had the most completed trips during the two-week period?**
2. **What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?**
3. **Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?**
4. **What percentage of all zeroes during the two-week period occurred on the weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?**
   *Tip: The local time value is the start of the hour (e.g., 15 is the hour from 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm).*
5. **What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two-week period?**
   *Tip: "Weighted average" means your answer should account for the total trip volume in each hour to determine the most accurate number in the whole period.*
6. **In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8-hour shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two-week period in terms of unique requests?**
   *A new shift starts every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work the same shift each day.*
7. **True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two-week period.**
   *Tip: Visualize the data to confirm your answer if needed.*
8. **In which 72-hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?**
9. **If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two-week period, which hour should you add them to?**
   *Hint: Consider both rider eyeballs and driver supply when choosing.*
10. **True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis.**
11. **Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight?**
   *Tip: Visualize the data to confirm your answer if needed.*

# Insights from City Supply and Demand Data

## Overview/Objective

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supply and demand data within a two-week period for Uber. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights to inform strategic decision-making and optimize driver scheduling.

## Key Responsibilities

### Data Acquisition and Preparation

- Downloaded and processed datasets related to city supply and demand.
- Ensured data integrity and cleanliness for accurate analysis.

### Analysis and Interpretation

- Answered key questions pertaining to completed trips, request patterns, and driver supply.
- Utilized statistical and data visualization techniques to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Driver Schedule Optimization

- Identified the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two-week period for efficient driver scheduling.
- Considered unique requests and aligned shifts with demand patterns.

### True/False Assertions Confirmation

- Conducted data visualization to validate the relationship between driver supply and demand fluctuations.
- Confirmed or refuted assertions regarding the correlation between the two.

### Data Handling

- Proficiently handled large datasets to extract relevant information.
- Applied data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure accurate and reliable results.
- Utilized data visualization tools to present findings in a clear and compelling manner.

## Results and Achievements

### Insightful Timeframes

- Identified the date with the most completed trips and the hour with the highest request volume.
- Determined the 8 consecutive hours with the highest unique requests over the two-week period.

### Weekend Zeroes Analysis

- Analyzed percentages of zero occurrences during weekends, refining results for Friday 5 pm to Sunday 3 am.

### Weighted Average Calculation

- Computed the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver, considering hourly trip volumes.

### Supply-Demand Dynamics

- Investigated the relationship between driver supply and demand, confirming or refuting assertions.

### Strategic Driver Addition

- Advised on the optimal hour for adding 5 drivers daily to maximize both rider eyeballs and driver supply.

### 72-Hour Zeroes to Eyeballs Ratio

- Identified the 72-hour period with the highest ratio of zeroes to eyeballs.

### Temporal Consideration

- Evaluated data to suggest an alternative "end day" time based on natural minimums of supply and demand.

## Conclusion

Successfully delivered actionable insights through thorough data analysis, contributing to strategic decision-making processes for Uber. The project showcased proficiency in handling and analyzing complex datasets, as well as the ability to draw meaningful conclusions to drive business optimization.
